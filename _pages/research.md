Our group investigates the mucosal complement system—its cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulation and consequences for mucosal, systemic, and anti-tumor immunity. We define molecular mechanisms by which complement–microbial crosstalk at barrier sites drives sterilizing immunity and shapes outcomes in mucosal malignancies (e.g., CRC). We recently identified a phagocyte-intrinsic complement axis that regulates myeloid function; ongoing work tests cell-intrinsic complement in pulmonary antifungal and GI anti-tumor responses. In CRC, we probe how commensal bacteria and the mycobiota (notably Candida albicans) modulate complement-dependent immunoregulation in myeloid phagocytes. We also study locally produced complement in protection against invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in hosts with quantitative/qualitative phagocyte defects. Approaches include clinical specimens, genetically engineered mice and fungal strains, spatial single-cell transcriptomics, highly multiplexed IF microscopy, in vivo models, and ex vivo primary cell and organoid–immune–microbial co-cultures.
