The research in our laboratory focuses on investigating the mucosal and systemic complement system, exploring its cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulation, and studying its ultimate effects on mucosal and systemic immunity. Our research builds on our recent discovery of an essential role for phagocyte-intrinsic complement in myeloid functional regulation. Current projects in the lab are focused on deciphering the mechanisms of complement regulation, activation, and its impacts on mucosal and systemic anti-fungal and antitumor immunity.
